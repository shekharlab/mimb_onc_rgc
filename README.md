This repository contains all of the code used for the analysis in **Defining selective neuronal resilience and identifying targets of neuroprotection and axon regeneration using single-cell RNA sequencing â€“ computational approaches**, _Methods in Molecular Biology_ (2021). The files and their contents are as follows:
  
  
  * `iGraphBoost.py`: all functions associated with the iGraphBoost method.
  * `iGraphBoost_vignette.ipynb`: a sample walkthrough to illustrate how all figures in the chapter were generated.

All datasets used in the chapter are available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AZJwImGoP1HTs7FwgDJIlgSrHitiuJpd?usp=sharing.
